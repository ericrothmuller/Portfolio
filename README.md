# Portfolio

This project, which I named Portfolio, is part of the 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio Challenge for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. My name is Eric Rothmuller and I am a student of the Boot Camp. In this project I was tasked with creating a personal portfolio that highlights my work so that potential employers could see some of what I've done in the past. Since this is a portfolio page that we will be able to add to as the course progresses, and I will eventually be displaying this to real potential employers, I went a bit beyond the acceptance criteria laid out by my instructors in order to better showcase my skills in a manner that I would deep appropriate. You'll see certain sections that are commented out that I'll get to later as the course progresses, for example: there is a responsive column section built for a future contact form in the contact me section that I'll add once we learn how to make contact forms functionable.
